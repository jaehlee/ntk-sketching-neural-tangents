# Efficient Feature Map of Neural Tangent Kernels via Sketching and Random Features

Implementations developed in [[1]](#1-scaling-neural-tangent-kernels-via-sketching-and-random-features). The library is written for users familar with [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) and [Neural Tangents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/neural-tangents) library.

[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) Implementations can be found in [here](https://github.com/insuhan/ntk-sketch-rf).
